Permissions and groups
######################

Status
======
Accepted

Context
=======
Not every user should have the same level of access to portal designer. At a minimum, the following groups should be
supported:

- <site>_Moderators: Can manage their site
- Global moderators: Can manage all sites
- Administrators: Can manage everything

Some users are designed as "staff" in edx-platform's LMS (Learning Management System). Staff users should be
automatically granted some level of access when they login (they should not see an error page).

Decision
========
A new group will be created with read-only access; this group will tentatively be named *Observers*. Staff users will
automatically be added to this group.

As discussed in the `new designer service <0001-new-designer-service.rst>`_ doc, when a new site is created a
*<site>_Moderators* group will also be created with edit access to that site and its collection.

The existing *Moderators* group will be enhanced to allow the ability to create, edit and delete a site.

Manual intervention will be required to add a user to the *<site>_Moderators* and *Moderators* groups, and
to make non-superusers *Administrators*. If a user is not staff, manual intervention will be required to add them to
the *Observers* group.

Roles based access control
--------------------------
Roles based access control (RBAC) was considered. However, at this time edX's implementation of RBAC requires a JWT
cookie, and edX's architecture assumes a microfrontend will supply (and refresh) the JWT. Portal designer does not
have a microfrontend. Given this, additional work would be required before RBAC would work with portal designer. It
was decided not to take on that additional work at this time since the current use cases can be achieved without it.

Consequences
============
This design should be sufficient for the current use cases. However, in the future it is likely that additional work
(and possible integration with RBAC) will be required as the use of the portal designer service grows.
